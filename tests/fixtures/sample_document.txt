Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability
to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use
it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is where you have input variables (X) and an output variable (Y) and you
use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. The goal is to
approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (X), you can
predict the output variables (Y) for that data.

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output
variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or
distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought
to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning has numerous applications across various industries:

- Image and speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial market analysis
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Natural language processing

Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks
capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as
deep neural learning or deep neural network, it uses multiple layers to progressively extract
higher-level features from raw input.
